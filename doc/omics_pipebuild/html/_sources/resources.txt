System Requirements
================
If you are running Omics Pipe on a local high performance compute cluster, please ensure that you have the following minimum resource requirements. 

* A minimum of 2 processors (nodes) with at least 32GB of memory  (the more nodes you have available, the more the pipeline can be parallelized) 
* Scratch space that is at least 3x the size of your expected results files. 
* Storage space available for ~200 GB of reference-related data
* Storage space available for raw data files
* Storage space for results files (~10x that of raw data)
